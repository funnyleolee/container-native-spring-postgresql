# Container Native Microservices with OpenShift Sample Application

This tutorial shows the steps to install and run a Spring Boot microservice with PostgreSQL in a container-native way. 

This sample application is comprised of:

* Spring Boot 1.5 with RHOAR for microservices *(In Progress)*
* Red Hat SSO 7.1 (a.k.a. Keycloak 2.5.5) for user management, authentication with JWT
  * Scalable, High Availability configuration using Kube Ping
  * Persistence with PostgreSQL
  * Pre-configured Realms for quick setup *(TODO)*
* Istio 0.4 (latest) for service mesh and security *(In Progress)*
  * Injection of Envoy/Istio sidecar proxy into microservice pod
  * Authorization of web service access via JWT and SSO with Istio Mixer rule
  * Mutual TLS
* Microsegmentation Rules (TODO)
* Prometheus (Istio Integration)
* Zipkin (Istio Integration)
* Grafana (Istio Integration)
* Service Graph (Istio Integration)
* Hashicorp Vault for managing secrets *(In Progress)*
* Crunchy Operator for High Availability PostgreSQL *(In Progress)*

The application has the following architecture:

![Architecture](architecture.png)

## Assumptions:
1. You have an OpenShift Container Platform cluster >= 3.7
2. You have dynamic volume provisioning available (it's possible to use static provisioning provided that you have enough volumes)
3. You are running the network policy plugin.
   * To enable the network policy plugin on Minishift use:
   ```  ./minishift openshift config set --patch='{"networkConfig":{"networkPluginName":"redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy"}} ```


Here are the steps for the installation:

| Step | Architcture
|:-:|:-:|
| 1. [Deploy the Crunchy Postgres operator](./crunchy/deploy-cruncy.md) | ![step1](./media/step1.png) |
| 2. [Deploy Postgres in HA](./crunchy/deploy-HA-db.md) | ![step2](./media/step2.png) |
| 3. [Deploy Hashicorp Vault](./vault/deploy-vault.md) | ![step3](./media/step3.png) |
| 4. [Configure Vault to use Kubernetes backend authentication](./vault/vault-kube-backend.md) | ![step4](./media/step4.png) |
| 5. [Configure Vault to manage the postgresql DB](./vault/vault-postgres.md) | ![step5](./media/step5.png) |
| 6. [Configure application to use Vault to retrieve the postgresql account](./spring/accessing_pg.md) | ![step6](./media/step6.png) |
| 7. [RH SSO installation](./sso/README.md) | ![step7](./media/step7.png) |
| 8. [Istio core installation](./istio/README.md) | ![step8](./media/step8.png) | 
| 9. [Configure app to use Istio](./spring/adding_istio_sidecar.md) | ![step9](./media/step9.png) |
| 10. [Configure Istio to do Mutual TLS authentication](./istio/enabling-tls.md) | ![step10](./media/step10.png) |
| 11. [Configure istio to do OAuth Authentication via RH SSO](./istio/enabling_sso.md) | ![step11](./media/step11.png) |
| 12. [Istio Add-ons installation (prometheus, Jaeger)](./istio/addons.md) | ![step12](./media/step12.png) |
| 13. [Configure microsegmentation](./microsegmentation/README.md) | ![step13](./media/step13.png) |
| 14. [Build and deploy the application](./spring/README.md) | ![step14](./media/step14.png) |


# POC Outcome (as of 2/1/2018)

| technology | production ready | comments |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| RHOAR | yes | the maven plugin may not be fitting for all use cases |
| HA database running in openshift | yes | - HA templates to be developed with the customer - day 2 operations still not container native |
| postgres operator | no | main reason: lack of integration with enterprise security, it's in the roadmap to solve this |
| Vault | yes | |
| RH SSO | yes |  |
| istio | no | privileged scc permission needs to be given to all pods running in the mesh |
| Application managed OAuth | yes | | 
| Istio managed OAuth | no | seems a very frail configuration at this point, future versions of Istio may solve this issue |
| Istio managed mTLS | yes | more testing required |
| microsegmentation | N/A | not completed at this point |
